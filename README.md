## Description
The code is a Discord bot written in Python using the discord.py and yt_dlp libraries. It responds to various commands, such as playing music from YouTube, performing arithmetic operations, and displaying server information.

The bot uses the command prefix "!" and includes the following commands:

* !ping: Sends a message back to the user with the latency of the bot.
* !sum <numOne> <numTwo>: Adds two numbers and sends the result back to the user.
* !div <numOne> <numTwo>: Divides the first number by the second number and sends the result back to the user.
* !prod <numOne> <numTwo>: Multiplies two numbers and sends the result back to the user.
* !hello: Sends a greeting to the user.
* !info: Displays information about the server, such as the server name, creation date, owner, and ID.
* !p <search>: Searches YouTube for the specified video and adds it to the queue.
* !join: Joins the voice channel the user is currently in.
* !exit: Disconnects from the voice channel.
* !loop: Toggles loop mode on or off.
* !play: Plays the current song in the queue.
The bot uses the yt_dlp library to download audio from YouTube, and the FFmpeg library to play the audio. The class is used to download and play the audio, and the list is used to store the songs in the queue. The variable is used to keep track of whether loop mode is enabled. The bot also uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to messages sent by users via !chat.
